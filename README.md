## Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of FreeRTOS on an ESP32 to manage multiple tasks, including reading from an ADC, controlling an LED, and handling a button press. The ADC readings are displayed on the serial monitor.

## Task Descriptions
- **Button Task**: Monitors the button state and creates the LED and ADC tasks when the button is pressed.
- **ADC Task**: Collects analog measurements for 2 seconds and stores the values with timestamps.
- **LED Task**: Controls the LED indicator based on signals from the button and ADC tasks.

## Notes
- Ensure that the button and LED are connected to the correct pins as defined in `config.h`.
- Modify the configuration settings in `config.h` as needed for your specific hardware setup.
